## Introduction

The aim of the project is to predict the trajectory of Atlantic hurricanes using Recurrent Neural Networks. A Markov Transition Model-based M2M LSTM framework is developed for this which predicts the next 5 trajectory points of a hurricane, given it's first 5 points at 6 hour intervals.
